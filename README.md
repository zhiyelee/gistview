# Deprecated.  

I have developed  another similiar application based on AngularJS. [gView](https://github.com/zhiyelee/gview) 



## gistview

View markdown files of your gists.

This is a partial copy of the [gist.io](https://github.com/idan/gistio) written in python by [idan](https://github.com/idan),because of not familiar with python,I write a nodejs version.

Demo:
> view the mds of gist `9403314`, visits [g.zhiye.li/9403314](http://g.zhiye.li/9403314)

## Deploy your own
